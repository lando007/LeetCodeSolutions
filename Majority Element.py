from typing import List
"""
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
